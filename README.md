# TypingTutor
Typing Tutor is a basic Java applcation that is used to teach the user the various skills that come into play when they're typing, such as the basic keys that their fingers should lay on. It has a basic course system that a user may follow, with difficulties ranging from introduction to expert. In addition to a course system, the user also has the option of a solo practice mode, where they can practice their typing with paragraphs from well-known pieces of literature. They also have the option to add their own texts!

Typing Tutor has the following features:
* Typing course system with ranging difficulties
* Statistics such as the user's average WPM and their problem keys
* A mode where one can practice their typing ability
* Settings such as font size, font colour, background colour etc.

Typing Tutor has been developed as a part of my programming project for the OCR A Level Computer Science programming project.
