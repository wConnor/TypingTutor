# TypingTutor

Typing Tutor is a simple program that guides the user through a course-based system of which teaches the user how to type and also gives them the option to practice their typing with paragraphs from famous pieces of literature. Typing Tutor has a range of difficulties, from Introduction to Expert with difficulties in between having their own individual lessons that are catered towards that ability.

One of the main focuses of Typing Tutor is to help build the foundational skills that can unlock one's true ability to type as fast as they possibly can, and that is with the use of touch typing. This is something that many students struggle to do and is possibly the reason why their typing speeds are not as fast as they wish.

Typing Tutor currently has the following features:
* Placement test to give the user an idea of their current ability;
* Descriptions for each of the individual lessons;
* Multiple lessons of ranging skill levels to suit one's needs;
* The ability for one to practice their typing skills in the Solo Practice mode (users may also create their own texts here);
* Statistics on a user's global performance, including their average WPM (words per minute).

Typing Tutor began development in 2018 for the OCR A Level Computer Science programming project as a part of year 2.
